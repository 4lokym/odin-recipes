It's a recipe website containing my favorite dishes.
The skills i learned is related to writing the structure of a site with html.
I learned to add images, paragraphs, links, lists, titles and various attributes and their meaning like the "noopener" and "noreferrer" important for security, the "alt" "width" and "height" attributes in the image tag, the "charset", "lang" and other basics attributes needed for a fully functional website.
