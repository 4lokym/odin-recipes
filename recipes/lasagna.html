        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This recipe is adapted from the official lasagne by the Bolognese Chamber of Commerce, with a few tweaks inspired by locals—adjusting the meat, wine, and whether to add milk. One non-negotiable: Green lasagne sheets are essential. The ragù is simple, with no garlic, herbs, or spices. Fresh pasta eliminates the need for pre-boiling.</p>
